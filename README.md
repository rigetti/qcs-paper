Binder repository for the code and datasets that underpin the results in the paper
[*A quantum-classical cloud platform optimized for variational hybrid algorithms*][paper]
by [Peter J. Karalekas][peter], [Nikolas A. Tezak][nikt], [Eric C. Peterson][eric],
[Colm A. Ryan][colm], [Marcus P. da Silva][marcus], and [Robert S. Smith][robert].
The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that reproduce all of the analysis
and plotting for the paper, using the data in the `notebooks/datasets` directory. All the
resulting plots and figures are in the `figures` directory. To run the notebooks in a
preconfigured environment on Binder, click [here][binder] or the badge above!

Alternatively, you can run the image locally with the following command (replacing `PORT`
with the `localhost` port you'd like to run the notebook server on):

```bash
docker run -p PORT:8888 rigetti/qcs-paper
```

This will start the container, and somewhere in the terminal output it will print a URL that
looks something like the following, but with `TOKEN` replaced with a long string of letters
and numbers:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=TOKEN
```

Copy paste the above URL into your browser, replacing 8888 with `PORT`. This will bring up the
JupyterLab interface.

## Docker Configuration

This Binder repository is built using the [`rigetti/forest-notebook`][forest-notebook] Docker
image, which comes with [pyQuil][pyquil] installed, [quilc][quilc] and [QVM][qvm] servers running
in the background, and additional Python packages for data analysis and visualization. To learn
more, check out the [rigetti/forest-notebook][forest-notebook-repo] repository!
